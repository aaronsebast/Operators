# Simple HTML and JavaScript Demonstration

## Description
This project is a basic example of an HTML file with embedded JavaScript to demonstrate the use of simple scripting and DOM manipulation. It includes functionality for:
- Displaying text directly on the webpage using `document.write()`.
- Showing an alert box to interact with the user.
- Logging calculations to the browser console.

## Features
1. **Dynamic Content Update**: The `<p>` element with the `id="demo"` gets updated dynamically with the result of an addition operation (`70 + 10`).
2. **Alert Box**: A pop-up alert displays a message for the user.
3. **Console Output**: The console logs the sum of `5 + 7`.
4. **Direct Page Write**: Displays "Hello ISMA" directly on the webpage.

## Code Overview
- **HTML Structure**: A basic webpage structure with a paragraph element and embedded JavaScript within a `<script>` tag.

## Usage
